      <h1 className='eaves'>About the Developer</h1>
      <p className='zatanna'> My name is Andrew, and I made this app. I am a web developer and D&D fan that thought that building out a Monster-Manual-Lite would be fun, and potentially useful to some people. It's a work-in-constant-progress, so feel free to <a className='inline-link' href='mailto:andrew.hollingworth@gmail.com'>reach out</a> with suggestions. You can also <a className='inline-link' href='https://github.com/andrew-hollingworth/DnD_Monster_Reference'>check this project out on Github!</a></p>
